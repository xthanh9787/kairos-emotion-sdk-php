KairosEmotionAPILib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. To do that,
provide the credentials and configuration values as a constructor parameters for the controllers

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses a PHP library namely UniRest. The reference to this
library is already added as a composer dependency in the generated composer.json
file. Therefore, you will need internet access to resolve this dependency.

How To Use:
===========
For using this SDK do the following:

    1. Open a new PHP >= 5.3 project and copy the generated PHP files in the project
       directory.
    2. Initially, composer was used to install the dependencies: composer install
       	Subsequently, these scripts were added to /vendor/apimatic/unirest-php/src/Unirest/Universt.php:
       		include_once ("vendor/apimatic/unirest-php/src/Unirest/Method.php");
			include_once ("vendor/apimatic/unirest-php/src/Unirest/Request.php");
			include_once ("vendor/apimatic/unirest-php/src/Unirest/Response.php");
		The vendor files were pushed to the repo, so it is no longer necessary to install dependencies

    3. Import classes from your file in your code where needed for example,
           use KairosEmotionAPILib\Controllers\EmotionAnalysisController;
        
    4. You can now instantiate controllers and call the respective methods:

	    namespace KairosEmotionAPILib\Controllers;

		include_once ("src/Controllers/EmotionAnalysisController.php");

		echo EmotionAnalysisController::createMedia('http://media.kairos.com/test.flv');

Possible error
===========

If this error is encountered: Warning: include_once(vendor/apimatic/unirest-php/src/Unirest/Unirest.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Volumes/My Passport for Mac/Kairos/kairos-emotion-sdk-php/src/Controllers/EmotionAnalysisController.php on line 14

Delete vendors directory, reinstall dependencies using composer install
Add this line to EmotionAnalysisTest.php: require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
